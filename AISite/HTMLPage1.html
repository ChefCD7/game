    <section id="examples">
        <h2>Examples</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Maps and Navigation:</li>
            <p>AI has drastically improved traveling. Instead of having to rely on printed maps or directions, you can now use Google or Apple Maps on your phone and type in your destination. Using machine learning, the algorithms remember the edges of the buildings that it has learned, which allows for better visuals on the map, and recognition and understanding of house and building numbers. The application has also been taught to understand and identify changes in traffic flow so that it can recommend a route that avoids roadblocks and congestion.</p>
            <li>Facial Detection and Recognition:</li>
            <p>Using virtual filters on our faces when taking pictures and using face ID for unlocking our phones are two examples of artificial intelligence that are now part of our daily lives. The former incorporates face detection, meaning any human face is identified. The latter uses face recognition through which a specific face is recognized. Facial recognition is also used for surveillance and security by government facilities and airports.</p>
            <li>Text Editors or Autocorrect:</li>
            <p>You may have used tools such as Grammarly as a student to check your final paper before submitting it to your teacher or may use it even now to check spelling in an email to your boss. This is another example of artificial intelligence. AI algorithms use machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing to identify incorrect usage of language and suggest corrections in word processors, texting apps, and every other written medium, it seems.</p>
            <li>Search and Recommendation Algorithms:</li>
            <p>When you want to watch a movie or shop online, have you noticed that the items suggested to you are often aligned with your interests or recent searches? These smart recommendation systems have learned your behavior and interests over time by following your online activity. The data is collected at the front end (from the user) and stored and analyzed through machine learning and deep learning. It is then able to predict your preferences, usually, and offer recommendations for things you might want to buy or listen to next.</p>
            <li>Chatbots:</li>
            <p>As a customer, interacting with customer service can be time-consuming and stressful. For companies, it’s an inefficient department that is typically expensive and hard to manage. One increasingly popular artificially intelligent solution to this is the use of AI chatbots. The programmed algorithms enable machines to answer frequently asked questions, take and track orders, and direct calls.</p>
            <li>Digital Assistants:</li>
            <p>When we have our hands full, we often resort to ordering digital assistants to perform tasks on our behalf. When you are driving, you might ask the assistant to call your mom (don’t text and drive, kids). A virtual assistant like Siri is an example of an AI that will access your contacts, identify the word “Mom,” and call the number. These assistants use NLP, ML, statistical analysis, and algorithmic execution to decide what you are asking for and try to get it for you. Voice and image search work in much the same way.</p>
            <li>Social Media:</li>
            <p>Social media applications are using the support of AI to monitor content, suggest connections, and serve advertisements to targeted users, among many other tasks to ensure that you stay invested and “plugged in.” AI algorithms can spot and swiftly take down problematic posts that violate terms and conditions through keyword identification and visual image recognition. The neural network architecture of deep learning is an important component of this process, but it doesn’t stop there.</p>
            <li>E-Payments:</li>
            <p>Having to run to the bank for every transaction is an enormous waste of time and AI is playing a part in why you haven’t been to a bank branch in 5 years. Banks are now leveraging artificial intelligence to facilitate customers by simplifying payment processes. Intelligent algorithms have made it possible to make deposits, transfer money, and even open accounts from anywhere, leveraging AI for security, identity management, and privacy controls. Even potential fraud can be detected by observing users’ credit card spending patterns. This is also an example of artificial intelligence. The algorithms know what kind of products a user buys, when and from where they are typically bought, and in what price bracket they fall.</p>
